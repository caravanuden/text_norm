## Text Normalization with RNNs

Text normalization is the process of transforming text into a single canonical form that it might not have had before. In class, we've used text normalization for storing and searching information in a canonical form; ie, in the question answering assignment we converted each token to lowercase, removed punctuation, and stemmed to improve the semantic meanings stored in our word frequency vectors.

Based on the [Google Text Normalization Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/google-nlu/text-normalization) on Kaggle, but completed for CS72 (Computational Linguistics) at Dartmouth in May 2018.
